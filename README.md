1. The ML Programming Language 
### **What is ML ?**
ML is best thought as a mult-paradigm language: it supports both functional programming (through a full array of tools such as anonymous first-class functions) and imperative programming (through reference types and "functions" that have effects).

ML is strongly typed, but most of the time there is no need for the programmer to write any type-declarations. This makes ML much more compact and readable than languages that requires explicit type declarations.

ML also has excellent support for Algebraic Data Types (ADTs). ADTs correspond more or less directly to algebras, which are one of the central themes of this courseâ€”and that is why ML seems to be the right language to illustrate the course.
